One potential way around this would be to construct a model that could predict ABV% based on the scored review features (e.g. `review_taste`) as well as the `beer_style`. This was not done as part of this analysis; instead, those beers without an ABV% were ignored.\n",

The disadvantage of this is that 5 is a relatively arbitrary cutoff. \n",

    "The table above presents 10 of the \"best\" beers as ranked by `review_overall`. We can see that beer 7971 is a very highly ranked beer, that has been reviewed many times (2527) and which received a perfect score of 5.0 a total of 1067 times (see column *counts with top score*). However, as we descend down the column *counts as best beer* the remaining beers seem to be equally \"good\" with counts in the ranges 800 to 900. One issue with using just this count value is that, as we saw previously, these beers aren't ranked the same number of times. Take for example beer 2093, which was ranked over 3,000 times; compare that to the slightly less than 2,000 times beer 731 was ranked.\n",

We can then rank the beer styles by the ratio of of beers that remain (w.r.t to the total starting in each category).
