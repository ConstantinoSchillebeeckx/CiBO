    "- The dataset is composed of a series of beer reviews containing scores for numerous categories. Each data entry also has an associated brewery and beer style.\n",
    "- The following attribute fields have special characters (e.g. accents) in them: `brewery_name`, `beer_style`, `beer_name`.\n",
    "- Several attributes have missing values: `brewery_name`, `review_profilename` and `beer_abv`. We aren't too concerned about `brewery_name` since we have associated `brewery_id` with them. However, `review_profilename` will be needed if we want to compare across reviewers. A total of 17,043 beers have a missing values for `beer_abv`.\n",

    "There are several issues with the ABV% data contained in the beer review data set:\n",
    "1. As mentioned previously, numerous beers (17,043) have missing values for ABV%; this represents about 25% of the total beers available in the dataset. It is unclear why this data is missing. One potential way around this would be to constuct a model that could predict ABV% based on the scored review features (e.g. `review_taste`) as well as the `beer_style`. This was not done as part of this analysis; instead, those beers without an ABV% were ignored.\n",
    "2. Some breweries have many more beers associated with them than others (as shown above in the intial data exploration), therefore it is unclear whether having only a single strong beer qualifies the brewery as having the \"strongest beers\". <mark>For this analysis, we will assume that a brewery must have at least 5 beers for it to qualify for this questions.</mark>\n",
    "3. The initial data exploration also mentions the inherent noise with the ABV% metric, especially in the high-ABV range; this will have to be taken into account when electing beers.\n",

    "We being by naivly looking at which brewery has the highest ABV% beers without removing any noisy data in order to get a general sense of the data. To do that, we generate a *beer dataset* which contains only the meatdata associated with beer, this is done by grouping the starting dataset on `beer_beerid` and simply grabing the first entry of each group. From this *beer dataset* we group on `brewery_id`, aggregate with *max*, and sort the breweries by max ABV*; the plot below shows the top 15 breweries with the highest ABV% beer.\n",

Where IQR is the inner quartile range, Q1 is the first quartile, and Q3 is the third quartile.\n",

The disadvantage of this is that 5 is a relatively arbitrary cutoff. \n",
    "- Brewery 6513 did not contain any outliers, however it now looks to be even more anamolous when compared to the reamining breweries; <mark>we therefore elect to call brewery 6513 erroneous and we remove it from consideration</mark>\n",
