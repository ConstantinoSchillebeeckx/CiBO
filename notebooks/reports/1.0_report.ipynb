    "- The following attribute fields have special characters (e.g. accents) in them: `brewery_name`, `beer_style`, `beer_name`.\n",
    "- Several attributes have missing values: `brewery_name`, `review_profilename` and `beer_abv`. We aren't too concerned about `brewery_name` since we have associated `brewery_id` with them. However, `review_profilename` will be needed if we want to compare across reviewers. A total of 17,043 beers have a missing values for `beer_abv`.\n",

One potential way around this would be to constuct a model that could predict ABV% based on the scored review features (e.g. `review_taste`) as well as the `beer_style`. This was not done as part of this analysis; instead, those beers without an ABV% were ignored.\n",
    "2. Some breweries have many more beers associated with them than others (as shown above in the intial data exploration), therefore it is unclear whether having only a single strong beer qualifies the brewery as having the \"strongest beers\". <mark>For this analysis, we will assume that a brewery must have at least 5 beers for it to qualify for this questions.</mark>\n",
    "3. The initial data exploration also mentions the inherent noise with the ABV% metric, especially in the high-ABV range; this will have to be taken into account when electing beers.\n",

The disadvantage of this is that 5 is a relatively arbitrary cutoff. \n",
    "- Brewery 6513 did not contain any outliers, however it now looks to be even more anamolous when compared to the reamining breweries; <mark>we therefore elect to call brewery 6513 erroneous and we remove it from consideration</mark>\n",

    "- a brewery must product at least 5 beers to be considered.\n",

We can see that beer 7971 is a very highly ranked beer, that has been reviewed many times (2527) and which recieved a perfect score of 5.0 a total of 1067 times (see column *counts with top score*). However, as we descend down the column *counts as best beer* the remaining beers seem to be equally \"good\" with counts in the ranges 800 to 900. One issue with using just this count value is that, as we sas previously, these beers aren't ranked the same number of times. Take for example beer 2093, which was ranked over 3,000 times; compare that to the slightly less than 2,000 times beer 731 was ranked.\n",
